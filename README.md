# turbo-broccoli
:godmode: (Name autogenerated by GitHub) My small collection of shell/bash scripts

- `sync.sh` - git push, rebase, commit, add etc.
- `venv.sh` - personal setup venv for Python projects
- `shell.sh` - chmod
- `everyday.sh` - update your packages (Pacman, pip, flatpak, snap)
- `runwhen.py` - utility, which show you computer work time in pretty print (this script I found in the internet, I only format file to PEP8)
